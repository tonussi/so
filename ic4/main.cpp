/**
 * Semaphore meaning
 * wait(S) indivisible (until calling process is blocked)
 *
 * If S is positive (S > 0), decrement S and return.
 * Will not cause the process to block.
 *
 * If S is not positive, then the calling process is put to sleep
 * (blocked), until someone does a signal and this process is selected to wakeup
 *
 * Signal (S): indivisible (never blocks the calling process)
 * If there is one or more processes sleeping on S, then one process is selected
 * and waken up, and signal returns.
 *
 * If there is no process sleeping, then S is simply incremented by 1 and signal
 * returns.

    /* Respostas das perguntas "para pensar":
        its not a good ideia put local semaphores for this example because we need a global
        counter to show all threads that are runnning a reference regulating the basket so
        the threads might have to wait to pick an item from the basket, in this case a "ball".
        in this program all children threads are called to join so all threads are called to stop
    
        here in this exercise the up and down of the semaphore are being used like in a way
        that appears to be pthread_mutex_lock and pthread_mutex_unlock. to make a semaphore
        go 'up' we just make sem_post and to make a semaphore go 'down' we make sem_wait
    
        so it must happen threading racing for up's and down's in some way that the semaphore
        will go down 3 times sometime downards his global counter to 0, them no itens will be
        available in the basket, no thread will have itens to play
    
        joining a thread that has already exited is possible (i think), so by doing this
        will finally free the resource previously allocated for this thread to run, these
        threads are called zombies.
    
        to see if a thread have finished operations we have to use pthread_join() like
        i did, in a block fashion, making the main thread ask for the other ones at a time
        to join and finish.
